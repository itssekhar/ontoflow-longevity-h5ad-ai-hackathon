Cellxgene provides two main ways to interact with single-cell datasets in Python:

cellxgene-census package: This is the recommended way to programmatically access and query the vast, standardized single-cell data corpus hosted on CZ CELLxGENE Discover. It's built on the tiledbsoma SOMA API for efficient data slicing.
cellxgene (local explorer): This package allows you to launch a local interactive web application to visualize and explore your own AnnData (.h5ad) files.
Here's how to use both:

# How to Download CELLxGENE Datasets:

There are a few ways to download datasets from CELLxGENE:

CZ CELLxGENE Discover Portal (Web Interface):

Go to the CZ CELLxGENE Discover website: https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/
Browse or search for datasets of interest using the various filters (organism, tissue, assay, disease, etc.).
Once you find a dataset, click on its entry to view its details.
Look for the "Download" button.
You'll typically be given the option to download in h5ad format. Select your preferred format and click "Download."
You can also copy a permanent download link to use in your scripts or share with others.
cellxgene-census Python API:
For programmatic access and large-scale data querying, the cellxgene-census Python package is the most powerful method. This allows you to interact with the entire CELLxGENE data corpus.

Installation: You'll need to install the package:
# pip install cellxgene-census

# cellxgene launch my_single_cell_data.h5ad --open

When you run cellxgene launch my_single_cell_data.h5ad --open in your terminal, it will open a web browser pointing to a local server displaying your single-cell data, allowing you to explore gene expression, cell types, and embeddings interactively.
