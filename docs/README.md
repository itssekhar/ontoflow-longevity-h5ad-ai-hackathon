# Documentation System

This directory contains the documentation system for tracking interactions between Gemini chat and the development process.

## Directory Structure

- `conversations/`: Contains records of conversations and discussions
  - Each conversation is stored in a markdown file with timestamp
  - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-conversation.md`

- `plans/`: Contains project plans and strategies
  - Long-term plans and roadmaps
  - Feature planning documents
  - Architecture decisions

- `tasks/`: Contains task tracking and implementation details
  - Individual task specifications
  - Implementation progress
  - Task completion status

## File Naming Convention

- Conversations: `YYYY-MM-DD-conversation.md`
- Plans: `YYYY-MM-DD-plan-name.md`
- Tasks: `YYYY-MM-DD-task-name.md`

## Usage

1. Each conversation with Gemini should be documented in the `conversations/` directory
2. Plans and strategies should be documented in the `plans/` directory
3. Specific tasks and their progress should be tracked in the `tasks/` directory

## Version Control

All documentation is version controlled through Git, allowing us to:
- Track changes over time
- Review historical decisions
- Maintain a clear audit trail
- Collaborate effectively

## Template Usage

Each directory contains a template file that can be used as a starting point for new documents.
